		Sphinx-Collections is a Sphinx extension to collect and generate
		additional files from different sources. These files are added to the
		Sphinx Source Folder, so that Sphinx takes them into account for the
		overall documentation build.
		Sphinx Collections supports multiple collections, where each collection
		has its own source and target folder, specific configuration and use case
		based driver.
