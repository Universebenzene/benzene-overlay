		This is a Python 3.7+ plugin for Poetry 1.2.0+ and Poetry Core
		1.0.0+ to enable dynamic versioning based on tags in your version
		control system, powered by Dunamai. Many different version control
		systems are supported, including Git and Mercurial; please refer to
		the Dunamai page for the full list (and minimum supported version
		where applicable).
		poetry-dynamic-versioning provides a build backend that patches
		Poetry Core to enable the versioning system in PEP 517 build frontends.
		When installed with the plugin feature (i.e.,
		poetry-dynamic-versioning[plugin]), it also integrates with the Poetry
		CLI to trigger the versioning in commands like poetry build.
