# Note for reproject
Due to the [compiling problem of the astropy-healpix](https://github.com/Universebenzene/benzene-overlay/tree/master/dev-python/astropy-healpix#note-for-astropy-healpix), some modules works with problem. E.g. while use the `reproject_from_healpix` module, the program will give an error: `python: cextern/astrometry.net/healpix.c:751: xyztohp: Assertion `phi_t >= 0.0' failed.`, where the `cextern/astrometry.net/healpix.c` is from the `astropy-healpix` package. No idea how to solve this yet. **CAN ANYBODY HELP ME?**
