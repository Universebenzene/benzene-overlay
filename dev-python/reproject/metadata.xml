		This is a package to reproject astronomical images using various techniques
		via a uniform interface. Reprojection means the re-gridding of images from
		one world coordinate system to another (for example changing the pixel
		resolution, orientation, coordinate system). Currently implemented are
		reprojection of celestial images by interpolation, as well as by finding the
		exact overlap between pixels on the celestial sphere. It can also reproject
		to/from HEALPIX projections.
