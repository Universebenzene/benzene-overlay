		Read Standard Zip Encryption 2.0 encrypted Zips 100x faster with
		same interface as the CPython standard library's zipfile.ZipFile.
		This is a fork of fastzipfile. I created this fork in order to
		add automated testing, building, and uploading of wheels to my own
		fast-zip-decryption PyPI repository so that installation is more hassle-free.
