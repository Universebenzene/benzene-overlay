		PySkein is an extension module for Python, implementing the Skein hash algorithm,
		one of the five finalists of the NIST SHA-3 Competition. While ultimately not
		selected as the winner of that competition, Skein may still be useful as an
		alternative hash algorithm, offering flexible hashing modes with various parameters.
		PySkein provides all features of Skein through a Pythonic interface and is released
		as free software under the GNU General Public License.
