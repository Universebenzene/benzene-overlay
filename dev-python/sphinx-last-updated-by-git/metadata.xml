		This is a little Sphinx extension that does exactly that. It also checks for
		included files and other dependencies and uses their "last updated" time if
		it's more recent. For each file, the "author date" of the Git commit where
		it was last changed is taken to be its "last updated" time. Uncommitted changes
		are ignored.
