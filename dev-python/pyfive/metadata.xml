		pyfive is an open source library for reading HDF5 files written using pure Python (no C extensions).
		The package is still in development and not all features of HDF5 files are supported.
		pyfive aims to support the same API as h5py for reading files. Cases where a file uses a feature
		that is supported by h5py but not pyfive are considered bug and should be reported in our Issues.
		Writing HDF5 is not a goal of pyfive and portions of the API which apply only to writing will not be implemented.
