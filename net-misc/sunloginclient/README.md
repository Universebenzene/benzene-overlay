# Note for sunloginclient
 This ebuild is mostly converted from [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/sunloginclient). When run on the system with systemd init, the newest version runs without any problem(might need running `xhost +` before remote controlling). While on other systems with non-systemd init, **remote controling FROM others may not work, as the newest version depends on libsystemd.so**. While the older one **`10.0.2.24779`** runs without any problem. You can either just use the older version or try enabling the `libsystemd` use flag to get a standalone `libsystemd.so*` package, though the [`sys-libs/libsystemd`](https://github.com/Universebenzene/benzene-overlay/tree/master/sys-libs/libsystemd) package in this overlay is just on trial.
